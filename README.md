# credit_card

This app has the main goal of reminding users that they have bills/credit card
payments. It should also have some way of seeing when the amount is due as well
as how much and what it was spent on. The app may also include some visuals that
indicate your biggest spendings in the form of a chart and a total amount owed 
between a certian time.
